            Electronic scrap, also known as e-waste, consists of discarded electronic devices and components that are no longer functional or have been replaced by newer technology. With the rapid growth of electronics, e-waste recycling has become essential to manage waste and recover valuable materials.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Recycling electronic scrap not only conserves resources but also reduces environmental pollution caused by toxic elements found in electronic devices, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. By recycling e-waste, we help protect the environment and reduce the demand for mining raw materials.
